# MySQL Walkthrough with Solutions

* The walkthrough folder contains live guide.
* The solutions folder contain pre-prepared code.

# Using sql files
You can import the content of .sql files by:

`mysql -u root < whatever.sql`

Replace `whatever.sql` with the sql file that you want to import.

**Important** The database `example` must exist first before you can import. Create the database in the MySQL command line with:

`create database examples`
